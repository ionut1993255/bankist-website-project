Welcome to the Bankist Website App !!!

On a general note, this is a presentation website for a fictional bank.
In order to make this website, I used the following technologies:
	* HTML5
	* CSS3
	* Javascript ES6

On entering the website you will be greeted by a friendly UX design using a pleasant color schema.
At the top of the page, you will find an interactive menu that I build from scratch using event delegation.
Seeing as this is a single page app, the menu will just scroll down to the desired part.

The navbar is sticky, thus it can be seen when you scroll down the page.

In the content of the app, you will see some tag elements, usually used in presentation websites along with
transform functions to horizonatlly scroll through the content in a UX frienly way.

I have also implemented a popup for the creation of a new account with the fictional bank but this is for 
presentation only and thus does not launch an actual request to a server.

Check out the custom favicon *wink *wink
